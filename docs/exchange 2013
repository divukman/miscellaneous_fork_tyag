One day I came back and saw that all my exchange services are disabled.

THis post helped me. http://www.itguydiaries.net/2012/08/omg-all-exchange-services-are-disabled.html

Specifically ran these two in powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName –ilike “Microsoft Exchange *” } | Set-Service –StartupType Automatic
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName –ilike “Microsoft Exchange *” } | Start-Service
